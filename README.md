Was able to include about 2/3 of the required functionality for this assingment.
Images showing this are included in the images folder.

User receives product details from the MySQL database.
User can select product ID of the item they want.
User then views the individual item they've selected.
User enter the quantity of the item.

Wasn't able to provide the function to subtract the requested quantity from the database.
I continued to receive errors while trying to make this work.
